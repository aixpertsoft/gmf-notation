# Contributing to Eclipse GMF Runtime

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

The code in this repository contains the GMF Notation metamodel, which is part of the Eclipse GMF Runtime project.

The Eclipse GMF Runtime is an industry proven application framework for creating graphical editors
using Eclipse EMF and Eclipse GEF.

The GMF Runtime provides many features that one would have to code by hand if using EMF and GMF directly.

- A set of reusable components for graphical editors, such as printing, image export, actions and toolbars and much more.
- A standardized model to describe diagram elements, which separates between the semantic (domain) and notation (diagram) elements.
- A command infrastructure that bridges the different command frameworks used by EMF and GEF.
- An extensible framework that allows graphical editors to be open and extendible.
